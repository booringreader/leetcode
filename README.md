### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
In the `.java` file, write your detailed understanding of the problem. 
Describe the problem statement, input, and expected output.
clearly outline the (implicit) constraints or edge cases to consider.

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
write the brute force course of action you took to the solution, based on the understanding of the problem
The overall Time and Space complexity of the approach.

### Step 3: Choose Data Structure and Algorithm
Document the data structure and algorithm you chose for implementing the solution. Explain:
- How it fits into solving the problem efficiently.
- Any improvements in terms of time and space complexity over the brute force approach.

### Step 4: Optimization
Begin optimizing your solution by removing redundant parts in your logic. Replace data structures and algorithms as necessary. For example:
If you're working with arrays, remember that arrays in Java are initialized with `0`. Thus, it's not necessary to worry about the indices of the output array that won't be processed by the nested while loop in problems like the "daily temperatures(l739-medium)" problem.
